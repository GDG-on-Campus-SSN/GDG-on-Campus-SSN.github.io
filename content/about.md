GDG on Campus SSN is a community-driven group for developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts at SSN College of Engineering. We aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice by organizing workshops, hackathons, and speaker sessions on the latest Google technologies.

Our mission is to foster a collaborative environment where students can learn, share, and grow. Whether you are interested in Android, Web Development, Cloud Computing, or AI/ML, there is a place for you here.
